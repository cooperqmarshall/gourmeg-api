Add <strong>2 large onions, thinly sliced</strong>; season with <strong>kosher salt</strong>. Cook, stirring often, until onions are softened and brown around the edges, 10–14 minutes.</p><h4>Step 2</h4><p>Add <strong>4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</strong>, to skillet with onions and cook, stirring constantly, until softened and fragrant, about 1 minute. Add <strong>1 Tbsp. white miso</strong> and cook, stirring constantly, until browned and beginning to stick to bottom of pan, 1–2 minutes. Pour in <strong>1 cup low-sodium beef or chicken broth or water</strong>, scraping up any browned bits stuck to bottom of pan, and cook, stirring, until miso is dissolved, about 2 minutes. Season generously with <strong>freshly ground pepper</strong>. Reduce heat to low and keep onion mixture warm until pasta is ready.</p><h4>Step 3</h4><p>Meanwhile, cook <strong>12 oz. spaghetti</strong> in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until very al dente, about 1 minute less than package directions.</p><h4>Step 4</h4><p>Using tongs, transfer pasta to skillet (a little water coming along is okay). Increase heat to medium and add <strong>2½ oz. Parmesan, finely grated</strong>, remaining <strong>1 Tbsp. unsalted butter</strong>, and ½ cup pasta cooking liquid. Cook, tossing often and adding more pasta cooking liquid by ¼-cupful as needed, until cheese is melted and sauce clings to pasta, about 2 minutes.</p><h4>Step 5</h4><p>Divide pasta among bowls and top with <strong>¼ cup 1½"-long chives</strong> and more <strong>finely grated</strong> <strong>Parmesan</strong>; season with pepper.</p></li>
